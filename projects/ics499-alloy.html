summary: Developed and designed with my team a Blaze/Meteor app that helps University of Hawaii at Manoa faculty and students to create, find, and collaborate on projects based on their skills. The app uses and requires an UH account, and lets users browse the many different ongoing projects on campus to help collborate or find other people to help collaborate. I mainly handled frontend, but did have to dip my hands into the backend. The app was delevoped during ICS 314 (Software Engineering) and ICS 499 (Independent Study).
