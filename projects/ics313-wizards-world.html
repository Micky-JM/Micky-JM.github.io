    - Command Line Interface
    - CLISP
summary: A simple Command Line Interface (CLI) text-based game, that lets you explore a small game world developed for ICS 313 (Programming Language Theory). The game is written in Lisp and uses CLISP to run. The game was made using the tutorial that was provided for me to learn more about Lisp and Macros. It features bonus areas, items, and macros that I made myself.
