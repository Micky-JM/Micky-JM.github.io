During the Spring Semester of 2016, I took a course on Computing Ethics. In this course we went over many ethical problems involving technology. The class comprised of mainly CS and Business majors, but there were also other majors that University of Hawaii offered.

Probably one of the biggeest takeaway from enrolling in this class, besides the Ethics, is the Assisting and Teaching a lab session. You had to assist and teach in either ICS 101, ICS 111, ICS 211, or ICS 311. The programming classes were ICS 111 and ICS 211. ICS 311 is the algorithms class. While ICS 101 is an introductory course that goes over many technological topics, Microsoft Office programs and lightly covers HTML with Dreamweaver; I chose to assist this class.

## But why ICS 101?!

Probably one of the most common questions that I get is this, mainly becuase ICS 101 is not required for the CS degree program. My answer, "Well why not?" I chose ICS 101 is because I have already helped other people in ICS 111 and ICS 211 while I was still enrolled and learning in those courses, so I wanted to try something different. But the biggest reason to why I chose ICS 101 was because I heard that it opens you up to becoming an ICS 101 undergraduate Teaching Assistant; and this was my goal.

## The Experience

Most of the time I would walk around mainly because students were too embarrassed to raise their hands but once they finally did, I was more than eager to help. The hardest but most fun part of the class was to teach a whole week. This was was not hard in the usual sense, but hard because of the fact that my public speaking skills were not as great as they were before. This actually made me re-think on applying for the Teaching Assistant opportunity.

## Hindsight

Looking back on the experience and the course as a whole, I had lots of fun. I met many great people and over time, my confidence for public speaking came back. This was a class I highly enjoyed and highly recommend even if you do not have to take it. As for the Teaching Assistant opportunity, I decided to apply.
