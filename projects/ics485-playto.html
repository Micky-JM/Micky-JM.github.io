summary: Developed and designed a 2D puzzle/platform game, with my team as a final project for ICS 485 (Video Game Design). For this project we had to create our own game studio, along with a website to showcase the work. I developed and designed some gameplay features and puzzles, as well as the website for the game. The game is playable on our website.
