tech:
    - C
    - C++
    - Command Line Interface
    - Program Structure
    - Linked List
summary: Developed a simple address book that runs through the Command Line Interface and utilizes Linked Lists for ICS 212 in both C and C++. ICS 212 is a course about Program Structure and Dynamic Memory Management, which has helped me understand and improve my programming skills even further. While the basic requirement was to have a single save file, I gave the user an option to create and use multiple save files.
