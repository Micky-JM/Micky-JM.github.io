tech:
    - Java
    - Eclipse
    - Object Oriented Programming
summary: Developed a music video for ICS 111 with my team in the Fall semester of 2014. ICS 111 is an Intro course, so it was the first time a majority of the class, including myself, learned Java and programming in general. Using what we learned about Object Oriented Programming and Finite State Machines, the professor, Jason Leigh, wanted the class to create music videos, and rewarded the Top 3 Music Videos. The music video features the song "Sad Machine" by Porter Robinson, and was made in Java along with using object oriented techniques.
award: Received 1st Place for Best Music Video Final Project that contained, give or take 30 teams.
