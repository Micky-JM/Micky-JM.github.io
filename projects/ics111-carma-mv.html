summary: Developed a music video for ICS 111 with my team in the Fall semester of 2014. ICS 111 is an Intro course, so it was the first time a majority of the class, including myself, learned Java and programming in general. As a final project the professor, Jason Leigh, wanted the class to create music videos, as well as rewarding the Top 3 Music Videos. The music video features the song "Sad Machine" by Porter Robinson, and was made in Java along with using object oriented techniques.
award: Received 1st Place for Best Music Video Final Project that contained, give or take 30 teams.
