summary: Developed and designed a pinball-themed video game for ICS 485 (Video Game Design), with another classmate. The game plays like pinball, and players must fight off monsters for a set amount of time. This was the first assignment/project we were assigned to develop for the class to learn how to use Unity, and implement computer science concepts, and techniques such as Objects, Classes, and Finite State Machines.
