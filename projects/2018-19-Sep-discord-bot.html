summary: Discord is free Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) application that offers both voice and text messaging. Using Discord's API, users are allowed to create many different apps, including bots for their Discord servers. There are many different Discord bots released providing different functions and different iterations of the same function. I am creating a bot that I yet to see with the function I have in mind, but if it is released it will be a great learning experience. The bot is being written in JavaScript, so it uses the discord.js library, a NodeJS module, to interact with the API. Since I am using NodeJS, I will be using JSON and MongoDB to store information. I also have plans to use AWS EC2 to host the bot when I am ready to the share the bot with friends and family. A public release is still undecided.
