Whenever I look at my old code from when I first started programming, the harder I find it to decipher. Back then I would just keep on adding onto lines or adding more lines to my code, which in the end, made the code very messy. Though the code was messy, it was not as I could still understand it the next day if I needed to fix it. I also thought that the future me was not going to refer to this old code anyway, but I was wrong.

Having take more ICS courses throughout the years, I found more and more professors wanting your code to follow their specific coding standard. Unlike some people, I did not find myself disliking the idea, instead I actually enjoyed it. As soon as the professors told us how their coding standards I found that reading code was a hundred times better.
