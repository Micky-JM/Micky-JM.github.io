JavaScript, not saying that I dislike the language but it is not my most favorite. Having learned JavaScript toward the end of last year, I thought that the simplicity of the language syntax was amazing and it still is! Now, like all languages, it does have it flaws but it is not the reason why the language is not my most favorite. While learning JavaScript, I was also learning C/C++ and really enjoyed playing around with pointers over the simplicity of JavaScript but I digress. Having to relearn JavaScript this past week has been fun. Reading that it is better to use "let" or "const" over "var" in ES6 has made me really appreciate the language even more. The use of "let" or "const" really helps me think of an algorithm and pseudocode much easier and faster.

I am now starting to take a Software Engineering class. I hope to learn a lot through the course, but I know it will be just the beginning of my journey. By the time I’m done with it, I hope I’ve learned enough to take the next step in my life as a developer. But until then, my fire will keep on burning.
