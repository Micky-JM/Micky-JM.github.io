## Introduction

In my very first programming class we were given a group project and looking back on the experience now, the use of configuration Management could have been very helpful. Configuration management allows a team of developers to work on the same project, whether its the newest revision or an older revision, without hindering each other. Configuration management does this by keeping track of every revision made by each member which then allows each member to oversee the changes and help them with the next revision they need to make. There are many tools that were made and released that offer configuration management, one of which is the well-known website, GitHub.

## It would have been so easy...

During my first year of pursuing a Computer Science degree, I had already heard of git and GitHub, and how useful they are, but I did not think much of it. In my second year I learned Source Code Control System (SCCS) through a Computer Science course and even did a crash course about git and GitHub that was led by a fellow Computer Science student. From both of those experiences is when I learned how great and useful configuration management is. After taking a few more ICS courses, I also realized that configuration management should have been taught much earlier in the ICS department because there are a handful of group projects, especially because one them is an introductory course. The ease of just uploading our revisions with comments is way better than having to email your files to each member followed by fixing the code so the application runs well when compiled.

## Is git or GitHub more popular?

I guess my question now is, "Do you mean back then or now?", because Git and GitHub really complement each other. I would have to say that, back then, git was popular because it was the preferred choice for configuration management. With git being the preferred choice, this made GitHub popular. While now, since GitHub has become really popular and used a lot throughout the programming community, a lot of people decide learn git because it just makes their work that much easier. In the end, depending on how you look at this question, there really is no right or wrong answer.
