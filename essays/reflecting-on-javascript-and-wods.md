Having learned JavaScript toward the end of last year, I thought that the simplicity of the language syntax was amazing and it still is! Now, like all languages, it does have it flaws. Not saying that I dislike the language but it is not my most favorite. While learning JavaScript, I was also learning C/C++ and really enjoyed playing around with pointers over the simplicity of JavaScript but I digress. Having to relearn JavaScript this past week has been fun. Reading that it is better to use "let" or "const" over "var" in ES6 has made me really appreciate the language even more. The use of "let" or "const" really helps me think of an algorithm and pseudocode much easier and faster.

As a programming language for software engineering, I believe that JavaScript is great. Although it may not be the best language it is still ranked within the top 10 languages. Even if JavaScript may not be all that great for desktop applications, the language really does shine for web and mobile development. With smartphones becoming more and more prevalent, even being used more than computers for daily tasks, the use of JavaScript will not be going away for a while.

After experiencing the first practice WOD yesterday with Amy, I knew I was going to like athletic software engineering. As I have said, the use of "let" and "const" really does help me think of an algorithm and pseudocode much more easily. Along with the pressure of time, I was also able to think of the algorithm and pseudocode faster, I even found myself catching small debug errors faster too. The only real downside for me, was overlooking the simple things to add, like calling the function, which really got me on the first WOD. All in all, athletic software engineering is a really great method of learning that works for me.
