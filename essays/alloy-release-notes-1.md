This semester (Spring 2017) I teamed up with [Ed White](https://spyhi.github.io/) and [Neil Teves](https://neilnthings.github.io/) to help out them develop and improve their app <i>Alloy</i>. <i>Alloy</i> aims to connect people through their skills and help them organize and collaborate projects together. In its current state, the app is limited to University of Hawaii faculty and students. To read more about <i>Alloy</i> click [here](https://alloyteams.github.io/).

## My Contribution So Far

Since majority of <i>Alloy</i> has already been developed, most of my time spent over the past week was to do simple improvements to get myself accustomed to their code before jumping into the code and possibly messing everything up.

<ul>
  <li><strong>Moved inline styles to global CSS</strong>
  <br />
  While majority of the project was developed, they mostly kept their CSS inline with the HTML code. I was suggested to move the inline CSS to the global CSS file to for easier editting and debugging.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Mobile Scaling</strong>
  <br />
  The layout of the project was well done for desktop viewing, but did not scale so well for mobile. I decided to fix this along the way.
  </li>
</ul>

## Upcoming Features

<ul>
  <li><strong>Object-Oriented Templates</strong>
  <br />
  While doing simple improvements I also had to find similarities within the HTML to turn into templates and treat them as objects to pass around the files.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Default Profile Images</strong>
  <br />
  Give users a few images to select from as a profile picture. Having implemented something similar in a previous project, I will bring over the code and improve it to be able to give users a selection of images to use for their profile.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Ability to Upload a Profile Image</strong>
  <br />
  After implementing default images, we want to give people the ability to upload their own image.
  </li>
</ul>
